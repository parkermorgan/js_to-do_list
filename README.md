# Overview

This project is a browser-based to-do list application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application allows users to manage a dynamic list of tasks by adding new tasks, marking them as complete or incomplete, organizing them, and removing them when finished. I designed the interface to be clean and responsive, with interactive elements such as a modal task creation form, hover animations, and color‑coded buttons that improve clarity and user experience.

The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of client‑side JavaScript. I specifically focused on DOM manipulation, event handling, ES6 array methods, recursion, exception handling, and storing persistent data using `localStorage`. Most of my earlier web projects relied heavily on static pages or backend logic, so I wanted to create something that responds directly to user input in real time and showcases what JavaScript can do on the front end.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment, along with GitHub Desktop for version control.

This project was built using standard web technologies:
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** for all interactive behavior

# Future Work

There are several features I would like to expand or refine in the future:

- Add support for task categories or tags.
- Implement drag‑and‑drop task reordering.
- Introduce due dates and visual priority indicators.
- Improve mobile responsiveness and polish overall UI animations.
- Allow users to create and save multiple task lists.
